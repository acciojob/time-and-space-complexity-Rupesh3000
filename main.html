  <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a way to measure how the running time of an algorithm increases with input size. 
        It helps compare different algorithms and choose the most <em>efficient</em> one. An algorithm with lower 
        time complexity performs better and processes data faster, especially with large inputs.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as the input size grows. When an 
        algorithm has a space complexity of O(n), it means the memory it requires increases linearly with the input size. 
        Understanding space complexity is important for writing memory-efficient programs.
