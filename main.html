	 <h1>Time,Space,Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a way to measure how the running time of an algorithm increases with input size. It helps compare
    different algorithms and choose the most efficient one. An algorithm with lower time complexity performs better and
    processes data faster, especially with large inputs. Efficient code often has time complexities like O(1), O(log n), or
    O(n), while less efficient ones may have O(nÂ²) or worse.</p>
    
    <p><b>Space complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as the input size grows. When an algorithm has a space
    complexity of O(n), it means the memory it requires increases linearly with the input size. Understanding space
    complexity is important for writing memory-efficient programs, especially in environments with limited resources. An
    O(n) algorithm is considered efficient when it
